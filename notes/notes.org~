#+TITLE: billgraphs - notes


* format
- all written in OOP format
- each script will have its own set of functionality, a reusable module
  - excelParser (reads Excel doc and returns data)
  - graphRenderer (given data, parameters, and returns a drawn diagram)
  - renderViewer (view the final saved image)
  - controller (UI to control these scripts. preferably in order of a process)
  - main (run this first. installs dependencies, if any, then runs rest)

* process
- read an excel document
  - should have columns+rows starting in same pos (e.g. 1,1).
  - columns should be ordered consistently (e.g. names, then DOB. not other way)
- convert data to python data
  - make table of variable data types? array of arrays?
  - or use an existing python module for making tables?
